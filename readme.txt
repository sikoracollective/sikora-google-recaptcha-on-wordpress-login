Adds Google reCAPTCHA v2 to the WordPress login page.

== Description ==

Sikora Login reCAPTCHA protects the WordPress login form with Google reCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot" Checkbox).

This plugin is an interface to Google's reCAPTCHA service. You must create your own reCAPTCHA v2 site credentials in Google's admin console and save them in the plugin settings. Google's script and verification API are used only after those credentials are saved.

Features:

* Adds the reCAPTCHA checkbox to the login page
* Verifies the response with Google during login authentication
* Settings page (**Settings → Sikora Login reCAPTCHA**) for your site key (ID) and Secret Key
* Leaves login unchanged until both values are configured (avoids accidental lockouts)
* On delete, removes everything it stored—including settings—so nothing from the plugin remains

Create credentials here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

**Third-party service**

This plugin relies on Google reCAPTCHA (a Google service):

* Terms of Service: https://policies.google.com/terms
* Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
* reCAPTCHA documentation: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha

When configured, the plugin loads `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js` on the login page and sends verification requests to `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` from your server.

**Privacy**

* No analytics or telemetry is sent by this plugin to Sikora Collective.
* When reCAPTCHA is configured and shown, Google may process interaction data according to Google's policies (see links above).
* During login verification, this plugin may send the reCAPTCHA response token and, when available, the visitor IP address (`REMOTE_ADDR`) to Google's siteverify endpoint, together with your secret key.
* Keys are stored in the WordPress options table and are not autoloaded.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which reCAPTCHA version is supported? =

Google reCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot" Checkbox).

= What happens if I activate the plugin without values? =

Nothing changes on the login page until both the ID and Secret Key are saved. Google's script is not loaded until then.

= Where do I get my ID and Secret Key? =

From Google's reCAPTCHA admin console: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

= What data is shared with Google? =

When configured, the login page loads Google's reCAPTCHA script. On login, your server verifies the response token with Google and may include the visitor IP address. See Google's Terms and Privacy Policy linked in the Description.

= What happens when I delete the plugin? =

Everything the plugin stored is removed—including its settings—so nothing from the plugin remains on the site.
